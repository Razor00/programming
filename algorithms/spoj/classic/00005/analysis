strings of type:
AbB

A > B : B = A
A < B : incr b, if b = 9, it will effect A, after changing A, B = A
A is reverse of B, incr b, if b = 9, it will effect A, after changing A, B = A


Ab1b2B

b1 < b2:
    incr b1:
    b2 = b1, may change A, B = A

b1 == b2
 same as single bit case
just make b2 = b1 at the end
